# color-saver
This application was submitted as a portion of a capstone project to obtain a degree in Software Development.

This is a standalone desktop application, that will allow users to record paint colors and details about the paint product, so that they may reference the information in the future when they decide to repaint areas in their house. It will also use this information to report on the most popular colors across all other users, and it will use this information to display the most recent colors used by other users. The users will primarily be adult homeowners, but long-term renters can find useful ways to use this software as well.

This aplication uses JavaFX, and saves user information in a PostgreSQL database served by AWS.
